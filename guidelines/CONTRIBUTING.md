## Guidelines
Here is a short list of guidelines to bear in mind while contributing to this collection:
1. There will be no issues for each asset in the collection, each user will use the ```collections.md``` file as a medium.
2. We will be blocking contributions only for assets that have arrived in pure state.
3. If an asset obtained via open source contribution ends up in pure state, the creator is entitled to 50% of the profit on the first sale.  
If we cannot reach the contributor, we will donate its 50% to charity or reuse it to improve the community.
4. Prompts generated from an open source contribution, must be shared into ```prompts.md``` file.  
Not sharing it will fall under penalty of removing copyright from the shared asset.
5. Molivair's generated prompts are not subject to publication unless exceptions chosen by Molivair itself.
6. The best assets are decided by the community.
In the absence of a community vote or tie, it is Molivair who chooses who ends up in pure state.
